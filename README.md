Weather_Parser
==============

Parser of Gismeteo website

Hello guys!
This is my first Java project.
Weather_Parser gets information from gismeteo.ru web page - name of the city and current temperature.
Then it shows in simple applet.


Thats all Folks!!)


P.S.: Sorry for the stupid comments - it's my first project!
